• How do I connect my project to a git repo that has already been established? 

      // When creating this project I think I just copied it from the mountainview directory
      // and now I cannot get a handle on uploading my new code to git. High priority
      
• How to deallocate memory? 

      // free() doesn't seem to exist and realloc(void *, unsigned long)             
      // throws an Implicitly declaring library function 'realloc' with type         
      // 'void *(void *, unsigned long)' error. Should I make a function?
      
• In a preprocessor directive, explainDiff("stdlib.h", <stdlib.h>); 

      // They seem to include the file but what is the difference between
      // using " " and < >?
      
• How to use CopyString(string)? 

      // Should I make a function to copy strings? Something that creates an         
      // empty value and grabs whatever is at the original string's address
      
• What is sprintf? 

      // writes formattred data to string
